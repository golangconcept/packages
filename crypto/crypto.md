# crypto Package

The `crypto package` in Go provides a variety of cryptographic primitives and `functions`, allowing you to implement security features like `hashing`, `encryption`, and `decryption`.

## Key Components of the crypto Package

### Hashing

Go provides various hashing algorithms through the crypto package, including `SHA-1`, `SHA-256`, `SHA-512`, and `MD5`.

### HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)

HMAC combines a `cryptographic` hash function with a secret key to provide message `integrity` and `authenticity`.

### Encryption and Decryption

Go supports various encryption algorithms, including `AES` (Advanced Encryption Standard).

### Public Key Cryptography

Go supports `RSA` and `ECDSA` for public key encryption.

### Certificate Management

Go's `crypto/x509` package provides functions for parsing and creating `X.509` certificates.

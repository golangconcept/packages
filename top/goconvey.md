# GoConvey
`GoConvey` is a testing framework for Go (Golang) that makes writing and running tests more intuitive and expressive. 

It provides a rich set of features to help with writing tests in a behavior-driven development (`BDD`) style, where you can structure tests with clear and descriptive language. 

GoConvey also includes a `web-based UI` to view test results, making it a useful tool for both test automation and interactive debugging.

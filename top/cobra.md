# Cobra

`Cobra` is a popular library in Go (Golang) used to build command-line applications. It provides a simple interface for creating powerful and flexible CLI (Command Line Interface) applications, supporting commands, flags, arguments, and subcommands.

Cobra is widely used in `open-source` projects (like `Kubernetes`, `GitHub` CLI, etc.) and is often paired with another library called `viper` for managing configuration.

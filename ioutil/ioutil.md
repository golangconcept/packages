# ioutil Package 

The ioutil package in Go provides utility functions for handling I/O operations, particularly for file and directory manipulation.

However, itâ€™s worth noting that as of Go `1.16`, many of the functions in `ioutil` have been moved to the `os` and `io` packages.

The `ioutil` package is still available for backward compatibility, but it's a good idea to use the updated packages for new code.
